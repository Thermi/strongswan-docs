= Measured Boot

Using *Remote Attestation*, the pre-boot phase based on the `BIOS/UEFI` and the
ensuing bootload process are measured, certified by the *Trusted Platform Module*
(TPM) residing on the endpoint.

== strongTNC Remote Attestation Database

=== TPM BIOS Measurement Policy

In order to enable `BIOS` measurements, add the `*TPM BIOS*` group in the *Device
Info* menu for a given device. Additionally set the *Trusted* flag in order to
put trust into the *Attestation Key* sent by the endpoint via the PA-TNC protocol.
The *Device ID* is the `*keyid*` of the AK, so that the correctness of the public
key can be verified.

=== Device Report

After the first run, the device report shows that a signed TPM-based BIOS
measurement has been successfully retrieved from the remote device.

.Device Report on TPM BIOS Measurements

The session details show that during the first run 136 BIOS measurements have been
registered in the xref:./strongTnc.adoc[strongTNC] database.

During the second and each subsequent run the received BIOS measurements are
compared with the 136 reference values stored in the *TPM Evidence* table.

=== TPM Evidence

The registered BIOS measurements are stored in the *TPM Evidence* table and correspond
to the xref:./pcrBootEvents.adoc#_pcr_boot_event_log[PCR Boot Event Log]. Only
the SHA256 hashes but not the log entries are transferred by the
xref:./attestationClient#_attestation_imc[`*Attestation IMC*`] to the
xref:./attestationServer#_attestation_imv[`*Attestation IMV*`].

.TPM Evidence
image::tnc_tpm_evidence.png[TPM Evidence, link=self]

The xref:./pcrBootEvents.adoc#_pcr_boot_event_log[PCR Boot Event Log] shows that
several bootload events (`*104*`, `*105*`, `*131..136*`) depend on the Linux kernel
version. Thus after a kernel update and a subsequent reboot on the endpoint, these
SHA256 hashes change, so that currently all *Component Hashes* have to be cleared
using the red *Delete* button.

== Attestation Client

The xref:./attestationClient.adoc[Attestation Client] is the TNC component located
on the client side, retrieving and transmitting the TPM BIOS evidence.

== Attestation Server

The xref:./attestationServer.adoc[Attestation Server] is the TNC component running
on the server side, receiving the TPM BIOS evidence and storing or verifying it in
the xref:./strongTnc.adoc[strongTNC] database.
