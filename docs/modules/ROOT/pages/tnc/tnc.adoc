== Network Endpoint Assessment

The {RFC5209}[Network Endpoint Assessment] (NEA) Internet standard
{RFC5209}[RFC5209] defines a generic framework on how the *state of health* or
*posture* of a network endpoint ({RFC5209}#section-5.1.1[NEA Client]) can be
assessed by a central management system ({RFC5209}#section-5.1.2[NEA Server]).

image:neaArchitecture.png[NEA Architecture]

The NEA architecture comprises three communications layers governed by the
following generic protocols:

* {RFC5209}#section-5.2.1[Posture Attribute Protocol] (PA)

* {RFC5209}#section-5.2.2[Posture Broker Protocol] (PB)

* {RFC5209}#section-5.2.3[Posture Transport Protocol] (PT)

== TNC Protocol Layers

One specific and up to now the only implementation of NEA is
{TCGTNC}[Trusted Network Connect] (TNC) originally defined by the
{TCG}[Trusted Computing Group] (TCG).

{RFC5792}[PA-TNC (RFC5792)]: Posture Attribute Protocol with TNC ::
  PA-TNC was derived from the {IFM}[TCG TNC IF-M 1.0] measurement protocol. +
  PA-TNC bundles standard IETF and/or vendor-specific PA-TNC attributes into PA-TNC
  messages on Integrity Measurement Collectors (Posture Collectors) and Integrity
  Measurement Verifiers (Posture Validators) according to standard IETF and/or
  vendor-specific PA subtypes.

{RFC5793}[PB-TNC (RFC5793)]: Posture Broker Protocol with TNC ::
  PB-TNC was derived from the {IFTNCCS}[TCG TNC IF-TNCCS 2.0] client-server protocol. +
  PB-TNC packs PA-TNC messages received from Integrity Measurement Collectors
  (Posture Collectors) on the NEA client side or from Integrity Measurement
  Verifiers (Posture Validators) on the NEA server side into PB-TNC batches that
  are exchanged between the TNC Client (Posture Broker Client) and the
  TNC Server (Posture Broker Server). +
  PB-TNC batches are also used to send final _Assessment Results_ together with
  optional _Access Recommendations_ and _Remediation Parameters_ from the TNC Server
  to the TNC Client.

{RFC6876}[PT-TLS (RFC6876)]: Posture Transport Protocol over TLS ::
  PT-TLS is a Posture Transport (PT) protocol protected by a TLS channel. +
  PT-TLS is responsible for transporting PB-TNC batches over the network
  between the PT Client component of the NEA Client and the PT Server component
  of the NEA Server and is usually used for periodic posture or state-of-health
  assessments of an endpoint continously connected to a secured home network.

{RFC7171}[PT-EAP (RFC7171)]: Posture Transport Protocol for EAP Tunnel Methods ::
  PT-EAP is an inner EAP method ({EAPTYPE}[EAP type *54*]) used within a TLS-protected
  EAP tunnel method like EAP-TTLS ({RFC5281}[RFC5281]) running e.g. over IKEv2
  EAP (strongSwan) on layer 3 or EAPOL (wpa_supplicant) on layer 2. +
  PT-EAP is responsible for transporting PB-TNC batches over the network
  between the PT Client component of the NEA Client and the PT Server component
  of the NEA Server and is usually used in the early phase when an endpoint wants
  to connect to a secured home network via VPN (layer 3) or over LAN/WLAN (layer 2)
  and its posture or state-of-health has to be assessed first.

=== TNC Protocol Layer Example

This example shows the messages received by a NEA server from a NEA client on the
{RFC5792}[PA-TNC], {RFC5793}[PB-TNC] and {RFC7171}[PT-EAP] layers.

image:tnc_layers.png[TNC layers]

The Operating System Integrity Measurement Verifier (OS IMV) receives measurement
data from an Operating System Measurement Collector (OS IMC) running on an Android
endpoint.

The measurements consist of three PA-TNC attributes that are packed into a PA-TNC
message of the standard IETF subtype `*Operating System*`. The first two PA-TNC
attributes of the IETF standard types `*Product Information*` and `*String Version*`
whereas the third PA-TNC attribute has the vendor-specific type `*Device ID*`
defined in the {PEN}[PEN] namespace of the `*ITA-HSR*` organization.

The PA-TNC message is delivered by the xref:./tncClient.adoc[TNC Client] to the
xref:./tncServer.adoc[TNC Server] in a `CDATA` (ClientData) PB-TNC batch. The
xref:./tncClient.adoc[TNC Client] can also request the language in which
optional _Access Recommendations_ and _Remediation Parameters_ are going to be
sent.

The PB-TNC batch is transported via {RFC7171}[PT-EAP] tunneled in EAP-TTLS over
IKEv2 EAP.

== TNC Client

There are two ways how the strongSwan xref:./tncClient.adoc[TNC Client] functionality
can be used to collect the *state-of-health* or *posture* of an endpoint:

* Collocated with a strongSwan VPN client (Network Access Requestor) running a
  xref:daemons/charon.adoc[`*charon*`] daemon that communicates over IKEv2 EAP
  ({RFC7171}[PT-EAP]).

* The stand-alone xref:./pt-tls-client.adoc[`*pt-tls-client*`] communicating
  over TLS ({RFC6876}[PT-TLS]).

== TNC Server

There are two ways how the strongSwan xref:./tncServer.adoc[TNC Server] functionality
can can be used to assess the *state-of-health* or *posture* of associated endpoints:

* Collocated with a strongSwan VPN gateway (Policy Enforcement Point) running a
  xref:daemons/charon.adoc[`*charon*`] daemon that communicates over IKEv2 EAP
  ({RFC7171}[PT-EAP]).

* A stand-alone strongSwan Policy Decision Point (PDP) based on a skeleton
  xref:daemons/charon.adoc[`*charon*`] daemon with the `*tnc-pdp*` plugin
  communicating either over TLS ({RFC6876}[PT-TLS]) or RADIUS ({IFPEP}[IF-PEP]).

== Software Inventory

One important application of the TNC framework is the management of
xref:./swima.adoc[Software Inventories]. Storing the complete version history of
all software packages installed on an endpoint in a central database allows to
proactively take countermeasures when a new vulnerability is discovered in a software
package because immediately all endpoints that are concerned can be
xref:./swima.adoc#_security_updates[listed] by the xref:./strongTnc.adoc[strongTNC]
tool.

== Measured Boot

xref:./measuredBoot.adoc[Remote Attestation] of the boot phase by measuring the
xref:./pcrBootEvents.adoc[BIOS/UEFI entries] and the boot loader before executing
them is also supported by the xref:./strongTnc.adoc[strongTNC] tool.

== File Integrity Measurements

The Linux xref:./ima.adoc[Integrity Measurement Architecture] (IMA) allows to
measure all system files and libraries before executing them. The file hashes
are extended into `*PCR10*` of the endpoint's xref:tpm/tpm2.adoc[Trusted Platform
Module] (TPM). The xref:./strongTnc.adoc[strongTNC] database stores reference values
of all file hashes so that tampering of system files by root kits can be detected.
