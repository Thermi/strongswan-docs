= Integrity Measurement Architecture

:IMA: https://sourceforge.net/p/linux-ima/wiki/Home/

The Linux {IMA}[Integrity Measurement Architecture] (IMA) maintains a runtime
measurement list and, if anchored in a hardware
xref:tpm/tpm2.adoc[Trusted Platform Module] (TPM), an aggregate integrity value
over this list. The benefit of anchoring the aggregate integrity value in the TPM
is that the measurement list cannot be compromised by any software attack without
being detectable. Hence on a trusted boot system, IMA can be used to attest the
system's runtime integrity.
